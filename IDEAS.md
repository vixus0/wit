# Hack the Police 4

## Ideas

### Construct timeline + map from witness statements and crime reports

  - Narrative is important
  - Could include CCTV and traffic camera locations
  - Nearby bus stops - correlate with bus arrivals
  - Shops or restaurants nearby
  - Bluetooth file transfer (location, time, witness details)

### Correlate stop and search with crime surveys (map)

### Phone screen AR for camera, witness and evidence locations

  - Like Streetview
  - https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/A-Frame
  - https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/quickstart


### Suspect likeness generator app using fake face generation

  - https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan

### Ontology for statements

  - Victim
  - Crime
  - Witnesses
  - Times
  - Places
  - Suspects
    - Description
  - Location
  - Photos
  - Video
  - Medical
