My name is Andrew Coleman and I live at the address overleaf. 

I have been looking round for a new car and recently saw just what I was looking for advertised on Gumtree. The seller's user name was KKmadrigal who advertised a Toyota Avensis WR59VXW for sale with an asking price of £4,500 on 15th August 2019. I had a short exchange of messages, with him and he said his name was Kev Kirby. He gave me a mobile number 07769 672138 and suggested we should discuss the sale.

We spoke on the phone and he sounded very honest and credible. He also had decent seller ratings.  We agreed a price of £4,250 which I thought was very good and I didn't want to lose the car so on the 28th August I transferred the full amount into the bank account that Kirby gave me. The next day I turned up at the address provided by Kirby but the building appears unoccupied. The address was Industrial Unit, 24A Priory Street, York, YO1 6EX. I then started to panic a bit and started to try and contact Kirby but he wasn't answering his phone. I then tried Gumtree messaging and emails but I haven't heard anything from Kirby since. He still has my £4250 as far as I'm aware. I'm willing to support a prosecution and would willingly go to court if necessary.

I have been left feeling really angry by this. £4250 is a huge amount of money to me and I'm not able to sleep at night at the moment, worrying about what I'm going to do. I'm afraid I might lose my job if I don't have a reliable car to get me to work.
