I am John Smith and I reside at the address shown overleaf.
At approximately 3:30 pm on Sunday the 10th of July 2016, I was driving a Ford Mondeo motor vehicle bearing the
registration number FG03 HAX, on the M56 motorway by Chester Services towards Warrington. I was on my own.
At this time my attention was drawn towards a vehicle which I saw was a yellow coloured car bearing the
registration number A 123 BCD.
The vehicle was in front of me travelling in lane 1 at about 60mph. It was weaving about on the road and I thought
that there might be something wrong with the driver due to the erractic manner in which the vehicle was being
driven. I entered lane 2 and drove past this vehicle. In doing so I looked to my left and I saw that the driver was
holding a mobile phone in his right hand and was either texting or reading something on the phone. I would say
that this distraction was causing him to drive erratically.
I have a PANASONIC DUO FRONT AND REAR "dash cam" fitted in my vehicle which recorded this incident onto
AN SD CARD. I have caused the incident described above to be made available to Cheshire Police.
I now produce this SD CARD as exhibit JS1 which I will retain on the understanding that should it be required I will
produce it to the police.
I have a mobile phone IPHONE 5S which I used to photograph the incident onto. I have caused the incident
described above to be made available to Cheshire Police.
I now produce these photo as exhibits JL/1 and JL/2 which I will retain on the understanding that should it be
required I will produce it to the police.
I am willing to attend any subsequent Court action regarding the incident I have described above.
