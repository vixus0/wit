My name is Tania Heathcote, and I am employed as a loss prevention executive at Gumtree plc. I have six years of experience in this role and have been designated by my employer as a person authorised to respond to requests from the police for data in circumstances where a senior officer has determined that the request is necessary to prevent or detect crime or other lawful purpose as designated by legislation. 

On 9th September 2019 I received a request from DC Abid CHAUHAN for data relating to a listing on Gumtree. On the basis on the information supplied to me, I have identified this as listing GH19/07620006/NGT/1. The following information is contained in our records:

 Our system shows that an advertisement was placed by a regular seller, Kevin Kirby (username: KKmadrigal), on 15/8/19. 
 Kirby offered a Toyota Avensis WR59VXW for sale with an asking price of Â£4,500. 
 The records further record contact from a registered Gumtree user, Andrew Coleman (username: Tralee15). 
 In a short exchange of 6 messages, Kirby asks Coleman to contact him directly.

Kevin Kirby has been a registered user of Gumtree since 11th April 2011. His registered user address is Petherton Road, Hengrove, Bristol, BS14 9BZ.




I can also say that the Gumtree user Andrew Coleman has made further contact with us about this listing. He has authorised us to disclose that he has registered for support as part of our Distressed User Support Programme.
