My name is Nick Gargan and I live at the address overleaf. 

I was today contacted by the police about my car, a Toyota Avensis 2.0 diesel, grey in colour, registration number WR59VXW. I bought this car in November 2015 and still own it today. I have owned it continuously since I bought it form a dealership in Bristol. I cannot remember the name of the dealer or the exact price paid, but I value the car about Pound4,000. I haven't offered the car for sale and has no intention of selling it. 

The police have asked me about a man called Kevin Kirby. His name rings a bell. I think I may have met Kirby in connection with a sale on Gumtree when I was thinking of buying a pedigree dog but I'm not sure and I certainly didn't go ahead with the purchase. 

I have never discussed my car with Kirby and haven't asked him to sell it for me. He has not got my permission to do anything with the car or to act as my agent for any business transaction.
