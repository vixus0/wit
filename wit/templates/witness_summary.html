<H3> Statement </H3>

<p class="guidance">
My name is Timothy Hausdorff. I am writing this statement by request of DC Jasmine ORLOCK, from the Thames Valley Police.

The following people were involved with, or near by, the incident:

  Adam SMITH: I do not recall having met or known him prior to the incident. He was walking together with a man with a red cap.
  Man in a Red Cap. I do not recall having met or known him prior to the incident. He was walking together with a man with Adam SMITH.
  Russell O'LEARY: friend of mine, I have known him for a long time. We were shopping together, but got separated.
  Security Guard: I do not recall having met or known him prior to the incident. 
  Shop assistant 1: I do not recall having met or known her prior to the incident. 
  Shop assistant 2: I do not recall having met or known him prior to the incident.

The following places are related to the incident:

  SPORTS BAZAAR shop

A few minutes after 14:00 I saw how the man in the red cap started yelling at the security guard by the door. A shop attendant came and the man in the red cap punched her in the face. The security guard tried to restrain the main in the red cap, but then Adam Smith dashed out of the door. The whole thing happened right in front of me. Another shop attendant came and stood next to the first, while the security guard restrained the man in the red cap to the floor. I think Adam Smith was carrying a large, black bag. I found my friend inside the shop and rushed to the side of the injured shop attendant. The PLACE referred to by ``the store'' is a RETAIL STORE, with name SPORTS BAZAAR, located in 8 Liverpool Road, Wilchesterton, WI1 4TY, United Kingdom. My friend Russell is a trained first aider, so he asked if the shop had any kit. The second shop attendant went to get a first aid kid, and when she came back, my friend started patching up the injured person. In the meantima, the other shop attendant called the police. The man in the red cap was yelling all the time. The security guard allowed him to stand and told him to stay until the police would come back. The man in the red cap reluctantly agreed, took up his phone, and made a call. I don't know to whom. Then the police arrived, and took me aside to make this statement. Other people were around us while all this happened, but no one else got directly involved. <P> 

Adam SMITH was short and not particularly thin. He had very short hair, very light brown, almost red. He had an ample forehead and a square face, and a double chin. His skin was very pale, but I did not see many freckles. He was wearing a light grey hoodie, and short, dark blue sport trousers with two vertical white stripes on the side. He had a tatoo on left arm, but I could not see what it was. Perhaps a flower, or some other figure with four symmetric things that look like petals. He was around 50 years old. He was male, 4 foot tall, white. 
The main in the red cap was tall, somewhat muscular, wearing a grey jersey over a checked red shirt, jeans, and polished shoes. His face was red most of the time I saw him, and I think his hair was blonde. He was carrying some metal keys from the left hand side on his pocket, on a chain. He was 5 foot and 5 inches, male, white.
Russell O'LEARY: please see picture attached.
Security Guard: please see picture attached.
Shop Assistant 1: please see picture attached.
Shop Assistant 2: please see picture attached.

I had the people invoved in the incident in view during all the time it happened, for about 3 minutes (20 minutes until police arrived). I started 10 meters away from the incident, then got as close as 1 meter. There were no obstructions to my view. I had never seen before or known any of the people involved in the incident, with the exception of Russell O'Leary. I remember the incident because it is pretty unusal compared with my typical experience shopping.  Only half an hour has elapsed since the end of the incident. There are no errors in my first description, that I can think of. <P>
