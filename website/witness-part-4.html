<H1>Witt: Say Hello to Smart Witness Statements!</H1>

 
<H2>By Anshul Sirur and David Tena</H4>

<H4>Thank you for your time and cooperation </H4>

These are the people you have identified:<P>

For each of these people, please provide a full description. Do not worry if you cannot recall all details; simply write all you can remember, and try to be as specific as possible. You will be asked for details later. 

Example: <i> Adam SMITH was short and not particularly thin. He had very short hair, very light brown, almost red. He had an ample forehead and a square face, and a double chin. His skin was very pale, but I did not see many freckles. He was wearing a light grey hoodie, and short, dark blue sport trousers with two vertical white stripes on the side. He had a tatoo on left arm, but I could not see what it was. Perhaps a flower, or some other figure with four symmetric things that look like petals. </i>
