Please write a detailed, chronological account of the incident. Refer to the people and places you identified previously. You will be asked to describe these people in detail, so there is no need to do that here.<P>

A few minutes after 14:03 I saw how the man in the red cap started yelling at the security guard by the door. A shop attendant came and the man in the red cap punched her in the face. The security guard tried to restrain the main in the red cap, but then Adam Smith dashed out of the door. The whole thing happened right in front of me. Another shop attendant came and stood next to the first, while the security guard restrained the man in the red cap to the floor. I think Adam Smith was carrying a large, black bag. I found my friend inside the shop and rushed to the side of the injured shop attendant. My friend Russell is a trained first aider, so he asked if the shop had any kit. The second shop attendant went to get a first aid kid, and when she came back, my friend started patching up the injured person. In the meantima, the other shop attendant called the police. The man in the red cap was yelling all the time. The security guard allowed him to stand and told him to stay until the police would come back. The man in the red cap reluctantly agreed, took up his phone, and made a call. I don't know to whom. Then the police arrived, and took me aside to make this statement. Other people were around us while all this happened, but no one else got directly involved.
