This short form will take you step-by-step in the process of completing a statement. The process should not take you more than 10 minutes. Before you start, please ensure that the agent has provided you with the leaflet:<P>

<H6> "Giving a witness statement to the police..." </H6>

This questionnaire will ask you a few questions about the incident you have witnessed; if at any time you have any query or concern, please do not hesitate to ask the officer.
